## How to play the game(s)

### Blackjack (WIP)

#### Rules

- The game starts with a dealer and a player (you) with two cards
- The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over
- The player goes first and can choose to hit (get another card) or stand (end their turn)
- If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the game
- If the player stands, the dealer will hit until they either beat the player or bust

If the dealer busts, the player wins

#### Start the game

1. In the terminal run `npm run blackjack` to start the game
2. Follow the instructions in the terminal to play the game
